# Mobility Explorer

[Mobility Explorer](https://tpp.pt/explorador/) helps you understand transportation networks in Portugal. Search for a place or browse the map, and use the buttons to view transit routes, stops, and operators.

Use Mobility Explorer to query and visualize transit data from [TPP](https://tpp.pt), a community-edited, open transit data aggregation project, and to analyze access using the Valhalla routing engine.
